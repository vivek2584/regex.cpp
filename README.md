> making a regex engine from scratch using McNaughton–Yamada–Thompson algorithm which transforms regular expression to an equivalnet non-deterministic finite automaton to match regex with input strings  
> this implementation is much faster with a linear time complexity than traditional backtracking implementation which has exponential time complexity
